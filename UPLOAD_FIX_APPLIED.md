# Upload Issue Fixed! âœ…

## Problems Solved:

### 1. âœ… Port Issue
- **Problem**: You were accessing `localhost:8080/upload` 
- **Solution**: Access `http://localhost:8082/upload` instead

### 2. âœ… Database Schema Mismatch
- **Problem**: Upload script used `cover_url` but database expects `cover_image_url`
- **Solution**: Updated upload script to match actual database schema:
  - `file_url` â†’ `content_url` (primary) + `file_url` (compatibility)
  - `cover_url` â†’ `cover_image_url`
  - `description` â†’ `synopsis` (primary) + `description` (compatibility)
  - Added `original_filename` field

### 3. âœ… Storage Cleanup Fixed
- **Problem**: File cleanup on error used wrong paths
- **Solution**: Track both file paths and URLs separately for proper cleanup

## âœ… Now Working:
- Storage buckets properly configured âœ…
- Storage policies active âœ…
- Database schema aligned âœ…
- Error handling improved âœ…
- File cleanup working âœ…
