# Next Steps for Supabase Implementation

## Completed
- Database schema for all tables
- Test data generation
- Basic data access hooks
  - `useAdminData` for admin dashboard
  - `useManuscript` for individual manuscript data
  - `useManuscriptList` for role-appropriate manuscript lists
- Feature flag system to control data source

## Next Steps

### 1. Configure Supabase Project
- Set up environment variables for Supabase connection
- Run the setup script to initialize the database

### 2. Integrate with Remaining UI Components
- **Manuscripts Page**: Use `useManuscriptList` hook
- **Manuscript Details**: Use `useManuscript` hook
- **Editor Dashboard**: Create `useEditorDashboard` hook
- **Writer Dashboard**: Create `useWriterDashboard` hook

### 3. Add Data Mutation Capabilities
- Create manuscript submission functionality
- Implement assignment creation and updates
- Add chapter update functionality
- Implement status changes and workflow actions

### 4. Testing and Validation
- Test with the feature flag enabled in one component at a time
- Verify data consistency across different user roles
- Ensure all UI components render correctly with real data

### 5. Additional Features
- Real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
- File storage for manuscript uploads
- Advanced search and filtering
- Analytics and reporting

## Implementation Strategy
Continue using the feature flag approach to gradually replace mock data with real data from Supabase. This ensures there are no disruptions to the current UI while we transition to the real backend.

Test each component thoroughly before proceeding to the next to ensure a smooth transition.
