# Fixes Applied - Mystery Publishers Platform

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ❌ Script Upload Error: "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'manuscripts'"

**Problem**: Missing INSERT and UPDATE policies for the manuscripts table in Supabase RLS.

**Solution**: 
- Created comprehensive RLS policies in `sql/fix_manuscripts_rls.sql`
- Added INSERT policies for writers and publishers
- Added UPDATE policies for writers and publishers
- Fixed profiles table policies to allow reading author information

**Status**: ✅ **REQUIRES DATABASE MIGRATION** - See `APPLY_DATABASE_FIXES.md`

### 2. ❌ Import Error: "Failed to resolve import 'react-paystack'"

**Problem**: Vite configuration was trying to bundle react-paystack package which is no longer used.

**Solution**: 
- Removed `react-paystack` from `vite.config.ts` manual chunks
- Removed `react-paystack` dependency from `package.json`
- Ran `npm install` to clean up dependencies

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

### 3. ❌ Import Error: "Failed to resolve import '@/lib/supabase'"

**Problem**: Some files were importing from incorrect path.

**Solution**: 
- Verified all imports are using correct path `@/lib/supabaseClient`
- All files already had correct imports

**Status**: ✅ **ALREADY CORRECT**

### 4. ❌ Manuscripts Page Loading Issues

**Problem**: RLS policies preventing reading of author information from profiles table.

**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive profiles table RLS policies
- Allow all authenticated users to read profiles (needed for author names)
- Maintain security for profile updates

**Status**: ✅ **REQUIRES DATABASE MIGRATION** - See `APPLY_DATABASE_FIXES.md`

## Files Modified

### Configuration Files
- `vite.config.ts` - Removed react-paystack from manual chunks
- `package.json` - Removed react-paystack dependency

### Database Schema
- `supabase/schema.sql` - Updated with comprehensive RLS policies
- `sql/fix_manuscripts_rls.sql` - Migration script for immediate fixes

### Documentation
- `APPLY_DATABASE_FIXES.md` - Instructions for applying database fixes
- `FIXES_APPLIED.md` - This summary document

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Apply Database Migration (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Go to Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
# Copy and paste the SQL from APPLY_DATABASE_FIXES.md
# Click "Run" to execute
```

### 2. Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Functionality
- ✅ Upload a script (should work after DB migration)
- ✅ View manuscripts page (should work after DB migration)
- ✅ Check that author names display correctly
- ✅ Verify no more import errors

## Expected Results After Migration

1. **Script Upload**: Writers can successfully upload manuscripts without RLS errors
2. **Manuscripts Page**: Loads properly with author information displayed
3. **No Import Errors**: All Vite import issues resolved
4. **Proper Security**: RLS policies maintain appropriate access control

## Security Model Implemented

### Manuscripts Table
- **Writers**: Can INSERT and UPDATE their own manuscripts
- **Publishers**: Can INSERT and UPDATE any manuscript
- **Editors**: Can SELECT manuscripts assigned to them

### Profiles Table
- **All Users**: Can SELECT all profiles (needed for author names)
- **Individual Users**: Can UPDATE only their own profile
- **New Users**: Can INSERT their own profile during signup

## Verification Commands

After applying the database migration:

```bash
# 1. Restart the server
npm run dev

# 2. Test script upload
# Navigate to /upload and try uploading a script

# 3. Test manuscripts page
# Navigate to /manuscripts and verify it loads

# 4. Check console for errors
# Open browser dev tools and check for any remaining errors
```
